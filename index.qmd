## About me

I am a graduate economics student, with a background in accounting, finance, business analytics, programming and policy/research evaluation. I enjoy working with data, whether it is scraping, cleaning, visualizating, applying machine learning methods or standard econometric analysis. 

Feel free to look through my previous projects and contact me if you have any questions.
