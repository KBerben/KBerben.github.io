title: "About Me"
---


I am a graduate economics student with a background in accounting, finance, business analytics, programming and policy/research evaluation. I enjoy working with data, whether it is scraping, cleaning, visualizating, applying machine learning methods or standard econometric analysis. Applying data, evidence-based assumptions and dilligent analysis to find targeted business solutions is one of my core strengths. 

Feel free to look through some of my previous projects and contact me if you have any questions.
