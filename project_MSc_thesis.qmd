- Methodology: translating relational databases into a comprehensive dataset, using econometric methods such as matching to construct treatment and control groups and testing outcomes.

- Programs used: SQL (PATSTAT platform), R, LaTeX 

- Output: MSc thesis

- Relevance: Conducting econometrically justifyable industry analysis, useful not only for economic research (policy evaluation of the Unitary Patent), but for business purposes as well (Unitary Patent characteristics, gaps in innovation, litigation outcomes likelihood).
