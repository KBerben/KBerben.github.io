## Project at a glance
- Project date: Spring 2025

- Research question: How do machine learning models help health insurance companies predict fraudulent insurance claims and what are the economic benefits of introducing such methods?

- Methodology: feature engineering, machine learning models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Models), hyperparameter search, threshold finetuning, cost sensitivity analysis.

- Output: 5 machine learning models, feature importance analysis (SHAP), cost-benefit simulations, firm-focused recommendations, condensed into a 15 pages long management-focused report. My most advanced model won the class' prediction competition, outscoring the other students by a minimum of 5% in the evaluation metric. 

- Relevance: This projects showcases my skills in technical analysis and familiarity of working with advanced models to tackle business problems. Furthermore, it shows my method of analysis: evidence-based, creative, high-level, aware of uncertainties and assumptions, focused on a requested end result.

# Scope
This project was a part of my Business Analytics class during my MSc. Economics at the Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien. We were tasked with predicting fraudulent claims at a health insurance company, and making a business report showing our research, method results and firm recommendations on a claims processing overhaul as an end product. The assignment contained little prior information, other than a few aggregate business metrics of our firm vs the competitors, and a dataset of 100,000 claims. 


# Introduction
I start my business report by outlining fraud and its financial implications in the healthcare sector. I calculate approximate cost of fraud to the firm, using insurer-specific metrics such as the fraud uplift. Then, I estimate savings of a claims processing overhaul that would improve fraud detection based on previous relevant research.

# Patterns in Fraud  
I conduct a targeted literature research to identify how healthcare fraud is orchestrated and which patterns it follows.

# Feature Engineering
Based partly on the patterns in fraud, I construct a list of features that do not exist in the data yet, but which I will create to predict fraudulent activity. While the dataset does not contain any individual or healthcare provider identifiers, I opt to create these and individual- and provider aggregate statistics to provide my models with additional predictive features.

# Modeling
I build models of varying complexity, starting with a simple single decision tree (CART) model, to an Optuna hyperparameter search gradient boosting model where I optimize the fraud prediction threshold for the prediction competition's evaluation metric (recall x precision). I call this model Optuna-LGBM for brevity.
