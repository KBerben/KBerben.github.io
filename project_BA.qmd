## Project at a glance
- **Project date:** Spring 2025 (grade: 100/100 points)

- **Research question:** How do machine learning models help health insurance companies predict fraudulent insurance claims and what are the economic benefits of introducing such methods?

- **Methodology:** feature engineering, machine learning models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Models), hyperparameter search, threshold finetuning, cost sensitivity analysis.

- **Programs used:** Python, LaTeX

- **Output:** 5 machine learning models, feature importance analysis (SHAP), cost-benefit simulations, firm-focused recommendations, condensed into a 15 pages long management-focused report. My most advanced model won the class' prediction competition, outscoring the other students by a minimum of 5% in the evaluation metric. 

- **Relevance:** This projects showcases my skills in technical analysis and familiarity of working with advanced models to tackle business problems. Furthermore, it shows my method of analysis: evidence-based, creative, high-level, aware of uncertainties and assumptions, focused on a requested end result.

# Scope
This project was a part of my Business Analytics class during my MSc. Economics at the Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien. We were tasked with predicting fraudulent claims at a health insurance company, and making a business report showing our research, method results and firm recommendations on a claims processing overhaul as an end product. The assignment contained little prior information, other than a few aggregate business metrics of our firm vs the competitors, and a dataset of 100,000 claims. 


# Introduction
I start my business report by outlining fraud and its financial implications in the healthcare sector. I calculate approximate cost of fraud to the firm, using insurer-specific metrics such as the fraud uplift. Then, I estimate savings of a claims processing overhaul that would improve fraud detection based on previous relevant research.

# Patterns in Fraud  
I conduct a targeted literature research to identify how healthcare fraud is orchestrated and which patterns it follows.

# Feature Engineering
Based partly on the patterns in fraud, I construct a list of features that do not exist in the data yet, but which I will create to predict fraudulent activity. While the dataset does not contain any individual or healthcare provider identifiers, I opt to create these and individual- and provider aggregate statistics to provide my models with additional predictive features.

# Modeling

I build models of varying complexity, starting with a simple single decision tree (CART) model, to an Optuna hyperparameter search gradient boosting model where I optimize the fraud prediction threshold for the prediction competition's business evaluation metric (recall x precision). I call this model Optuna-LGBM-BIZ for brevity. It is constructed as follows:
1. I define an objective function which uses Optuna to semi-randomly search over gradient booster hyperparameter space to find the optimal set of LGBM parameters to maximize the business metric over 30 trials. each trial containing a 5-fold cross-validation type LGBM with different sets of parameters.
2. I take the best performing set of hyperparameters to fit the LGBM on the full training dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation setting, whereafter I find the mean optimal threshold for predicting fraud, which maximizes the business score again.
3. A feature analysis tells me which information is relatively important in predicting fraud. Based on this, I engineer more features or specific interactions between features, marginally improving predictive power.
4. I run the model on the test data and compare its outcomes with the less complicated models.

Note that the ROC-AUC metric is only 0.55, which means that the models perform only slightly better than guessing fraud. The only marginal increases in predictive power when increasing model complexity is a sign that feature engineering and patterns in fraud are the bottleneck in this case. The following plots illustrate this:

As can be seen above, it is hard to separate fraudulent from non-fraudulent claims. The best that this model can do is give an indication of which claims to further investigate for fraud. 

# Cost-Benefit Analysis
I categorize my model's predicted fraud based on probability bins, whereafter I calculate how much the real fraudulent claims per bin have cost the firm using the dataset. Then, I estimate the investigation cost per bin, using literature-backed estimates. I show that the benefit of investigating fraud depends on how sure the model is that a claim is fraudulent, how much the average fraudulent claim can be saved and how high the investigation costs are for investigating every claim in that probability bin.

Next, I theorize that investigation costs are not linear, and that they are small while investigating the first 1000-1500 cases, they grow exponentially above that number due to processing constraints. Fitting to a business report, I then estimate the maximum net savings for the business given the current assumptions.

To conclude my research, I give targeted recommendations for improving the claims processing and which claims to investigate for maximum estimated net savings. Lastly, I compare the total estimated savings with the literature and find that they align well.
