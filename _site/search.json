    "text": "Project date: Spring 2025\nResearch question: How do machine learning models help health insurance companies predict fraudulent insurance claims and what are the economic benefits of introducing such methods?\nMethodology: feature engineering, machine learning models (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Models), hyperparameter search, threshold finetuning, cost sensitivity analysis.\nOutput: 5 machine learning models, feature importance analysis (SHAP), cost-benefit simulations, firm-focused recommendations, condensed into a 15 pages long management-focused report. My most advanced model won the class’ prediction competition, outscoring the other students by a minimum of 5% in the evaluation metric.\nRelevance: This projects showcases my skills in technical analysis and familiarity of working with advanced models to tackle business problems. Furthermore, it shows my method of analysis: evidence-based, creative, high-level, aware of uncertainties and assumptions, focused on a requested end result."
